1. What is Node js and Architecture?
=> Node is cross-platform and Javascript run-time enviroment.
=> It is built on Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine
=> Architecture => To manage several concurrent clients => Node.js employs a “Single Threaded Event Loop” design.
=> Components of the Node.js Architecture:
a. Requests => User need to perform some action => 2 types of request => Blocking (complex) and Non-blocking (Simple)
b. NodeJs Server => Server accept all request => Process them => Return results
c. Event Queue => Storing requests => Pass them to the Event loop
d. Event loop => Recieve requests => send response to the client
e. Thread pool => Contain thread => Perform Operation 
=> For blocking requests, a single thread is assigned to the process for completing the task by using external resources.

2. What is the structure for Node js?

=> app.js
=> src => connections => MongoDB => connection.js
       => routes => routes.js
                 => user-routes.js
       => models => user-model.js
       => middlewares => custom-middlewares.js
       => controllers => user-controllers.js
       => services => authentication.js
       => validation => index.js
                     => schema.js

3. What is middleware and example?
=> middleware is a function 
=> In request and response cycle 
=> that function have access of request 
=> responading the object as well as pass to the next middleware
=> example => HTTP, static (pass image or html), JSON , urlencoded
=> custum middleware => Autherization, Authentication, Validation etc
=> Code
  const customMiddleware = (req,res,next)=>{
    // manipulation accordingly
    next()
}

4. Optimize nodeJs API
=> Always use of asynchronous functions
=> Optimize Database queries
=> Clustering => with pm2
=> Used HTTP2 instaead of HTTP (Multiplexing, Header compression, Server push, Binary Format)
=> Run tasks in Parallel => reduce letency and minimizes blocking opertaions.
=> Use Redis to catch 
=> Avoid session and cookies in APIs and send only APIs data
=> Use Error scripting with logging

5. Clustering 
=> Cluster allow to create multiple parallel instance of server or Scalling.

6. PM2
=> APM => Application process manager
=> performance monitering manager (CPU, Memory usage, response time, event loop letency etc)
=> Provide logger for all instance at same time
=> production process manager with in build load balancer
=> Zero downtime reload
