1. React
=> React is front-end javascript library
=> it follow component based approach which help in building reusable UI component
=> It uses virtual dom instead of Real dom
=> it follow uni-directional data flow
=> React is libarary NOT FRAMEWORK so, we can easily intigrate with any framework like ANGULAR, VUE etc

=> we can configure it with the use of CDM LINKS
  => Import 2 files => React development js => Core of react
                    => React Dom => using this we can render our source code on web-site as well as on mobile application (like React native)

=> Code
  <div id="root"></div>
  <script>
      const heading = React.createElement("h1",{},"HELLO WORLD")
      const root = ReactDom.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
      root.render(heading)
  </script>

=> root reder is helping to convert react object to understandable by browser code
=> Most costly operation in front-end or enhancing the user experience is updating DOM.
=> React working on the concept to manipulate the DOM using javascript.

2. NPM (Node package manager)
=> package.json => configuration of npm
                => dependency package
                => npm take care of version of package
=> package-lock.json => keep track of exact version of every package
                     => save version of our dependencies package to package dependencies
=> NOTE => above both file we have to update on git so, all the servers are on the same track

3. npm vs npx
=> npm => installing packages
=> npx => executing the packages

4. Transitive dependencies
=> our project have some dependencies on other pakage and other package have thier own dependencies and that dependencies are transitive.

5. why we need import in React?
=> React is library so we have to import it first and it come from node-modules

6. Bundler ( Best => web-pack, parcel, vite)
=> Most important package in our project
    => Dev-build => provide localhost or local server
    => Local-server
    => HMR ( HOT module replacement ) => after save update local file
    => File watching algorithm
    => Faster build using catching
    => Image optimization
    => Minification => optmize js,html,css
    => Bundling => combine many file into single file
    => Compressing the code => Remove spaces and all
    => Code Spliting
    => Tree shaking => remove unused code and files
    => HTTPS => Provide https functionality
    => Different build for dev as well as for production

7. browser list => handle code in other browsers

8. JSX => Javascipt xml 
=> HTML like syntax
=> JSX is made for developer to easy understand while writing the code.
    => const heading = React.createElement("h1",{},"Hello world")
    => const heading = <h1>Hello world</h1>

    => Above both is same but browser didn't uderstand this only understand ECMASCRIPT
    => Above both return React object.
=> Before going to browser => Bundler transpiled 
=> All the bundlers are transpiled with the help of BABEL

9. Babel
=> Babel is javascript compiler as well as transpiler 
=> take jsx and converted into js engine understood language as well as react understood
=> Babel understand with the help of angular bracket (<,>)

10. Componets
=> Components are self contained reusable code
=> type => Class component => there own lifecycle 
                           => constructor, ComponentDidMount, ComponentDidUpdate, ComponentDidUnmount 
                           => for state management => this.state and this.setstate
        => functional component => No lifycle 
                                => we can achieve it with the help of react hooks 
                                => useState, UseEffect

11. useEffect
=> useEffect(()=>{},[]) => call initially as componentDidMount
=> useEffect(()=>,{},[xyz]) => call callback function when previous xyz and current have some changes

12. Hooks
=> useState => For managing state
=> useEffect => trigerring for some call back function
=> useContext => getting details for context
=> useReducer => updating resux state using actions
=> useSelector => Getting all details from store
=> useParams => getting details of params of route
=> useRefs => element refs
=> useMemo => for memoization
=> useCallback => return a memoize function

13. State management
=> State/props => handling component using own state and handle child component from parent using props
=> props drilling
=> context API => for overcome props drilling
=> data sharing between two siblings => using context api

14. State management tools
=> Redux/Zusland => Redux toolkit
=> It provides a centralized store to manage the entire state of an application.
=> Store intialization => Dispatching => Reducer => subscribe Selector => Render
=> Connfigure with the help of app store and useReducer and useSelector
