1. AngularJs is a framework of javascript in which we can develop web, mobile, and desktop applications.

2. Key Components
  a. Modules -> Application can divided into logical sub-features.
  b. Components -> Basic building blocks of Application for controlling HTML Views.
  c. Templates -> Representation of view as HTML.
  d. Services -> Shared components and Functions to the entire application.
  e. MetaData ->

3. Directives -> It adds behavior exiting DOM element as adding a background yellow color so we can create a directive and use it.
  => e.g => <p myHighlight>Highlight me!</p>

4. Decorators -> important for defining and configuring various application elements, 
              -> providing an easy way to enhance the classes with additional functionality and provide metadata.

5. Types of Decorators
  -> Class Decorators -> @components and @ngModules
  -> Property Decorators -> @Input and @Output
  -> Parameter decorators -> @inject

6. Sharing Data between two components
  -> Parent to child 
      -> e.g  <app-item-detail [item]="currentItem"></app-item-detail> // Parent Components 

              import { Component, Input } from '@angular/core'; // Child component
              export class ItemDetailComponent {
                @Input() item = ''; // decorate the property with @Input()
              }

  -> Child to Parent
    -> Child Component
        export class ItemOutputComponent {
        @Output() newItemEvent = new EventEmitter<string>();
        addNewItem(value: string) {
          this.newItemEvent.emit(value);
        }
      }
    -> parent Component
      <app-item-output (newItemEvent)="addItem($event)"></app-item-output>
